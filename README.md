# Finite Fields 
Here is an attempt to make my version of functional reconstruction, i.e., interpolation of polynomials and rational functions on discrete samplings.

## Finite fields Z_p
### Ffield.lhs
For rational number reconstruction.
Extended Euclidean algorithm, chinese remainder theorem.
It passed QuickCheck.

# Function reconstruction
## Univariate polynomial 
Newton interpolation
## Univariate rational function 
Thiele interpolation

## Multivariate polynomial
## Multivariate rational function
