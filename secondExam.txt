Integrand Reduction reloaded
Algebraic Geometry and Finite Fields

abstract:
(From APS meeting)
The evaluation of scattering amplitudes in quantum field theory allows us
to compare the phenomenological prediction of particle theory with the 
measurement at collider experiments.
The study of scattering amplitudes, in terms of their symmetries and 
analytic properties, provides a theoretical framework to develop techniques 
and efficient algorithms for the evaluation of physical cross sections and
differential distributions.
Tree-level calculations have been known for a long time.
Loop amplitudes, which are needed to reduce the theoretical uncertainty, are
more challenging since they involves a large number of Feynman diagrams, 
expressed as integrals of rational functions.
At one-loop, the problem has been solved thanks to the combined effect of
integrand reduction, such as the OPP method and unitarity.
However, plenty of work is still needed at higher orders, starting with 
the two-loop case.
Recently, integrand reduction has been revisited using algebraic geometry.

I will review the salient features of integrand reduction for dimensionally 
regulated Feynman integrals, and describe an interesting technique for their
reduction based on multivariate polynomial division.
I will explain the basics of functional reconstruction techniques, and show
a novel approach to improve its efficiency by introducing finite fields.
