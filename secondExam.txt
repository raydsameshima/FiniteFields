Integrand Reduction reloaded; Algebraic Geometry and Finite Fields

(From APS meeting)
The evaluation of scattering amplitudes in quantum field theory allows us
to compare the phenomenological prediction of particle theory with the 
measurement at collider experiments.
The study of scattering amplitudes, in terms of their symmetries and 
analytic properties, provides a theoretical framework to develop techniques 
and efficient algorithms for the evaluation of physical cross sections and
differential distributions.
Tree-level calculations have been known for a long time.
Loop amplitudes, which are needed to reduce the theoretical uncertainty, are
more challenging since they involves a large number of Feynman diagrams, 
expressed as integrals of rational functions.
At one-loop, the problem has been solved thanks to the combined effect of
integrand reduction, such as the OPP method and unitarity.
However, plenty of work is still needed at higher orders, starting with 
the two-loop case.
Recently, integrand reduction has been revisited using algebraic geometry.

Algebraic geometry provides a systematic formalism to deal with integral
reduction as multivariate polynomial division, and Groebner basis plays
a main role in the reduction.
After the reduction, outcomes can be mathematically complicated forms.
Instead of treating them symbolically to canonicalize, we can simply 
evaluate such functions on integers and reconstruct them.
This functional reconstruction uses four basic arithmetic operation, i.e., addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.
We usually perform such operations over the rational number field on 
computer systems.
The rational number field consists of an infinite set, and this fact can 
cause overflow in the intermediate step of canonicalization.
By introducing a finite field, which is quotient ring of a prime, these four
operations are closed in a finite set, and no overflows.
We also gain the efficiency of reconstruction over finite fields.
We can remap the canonicalized function on the rational field using Chinese remainder theorem.
